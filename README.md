AbsoluteValuesSumMinimization:Given a sorted array of integers a, your task is to determine which element of a is closest to all other values of a. In other words, find the element x in a, which minimizes the following sum:abs(a[0] - x) + abs(a[1] - x) + ... + abs(a[a.length - 1] - x)

AddBorder: Given a rectangular matrix of characters, add a border of asterisks(*) to it.

AllLongestString: Given an array of strings, return another array containing all of its longest strings.

ArrayChange: You are given an array of integers. On each move you are allowed to increase exactly one of its element by one. Find the minimal number of moves required to obtain a strictly increasing sequence from the input.

AvoidObstacles: You are given an array of integers representing coordinates of obstacles situated on a straight line.
Assume that you are jumping from the point with coordinate 0 to the right. You are allowed only to make jumps of the same length represented by some integer.
Find the minimal length of the jump enough to avoid all the obstacles.
